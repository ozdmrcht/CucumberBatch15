  #HOOKS: For defining pre and Post steps in any Cucumber framework
    #     : This is always created inside the StepDefinitions folder
    #     : Hooks will take care of pre and post conditions irrespective
    #     : of what goes in between the test steps

    #BACKGROUND: Its the clubbing of common steps in different scenarios of a feature file
   #             till flow is not broken
   #1. Hard Code
   #2. Config file
   #-----------------Cucumber itself provides multiple option through which we can feed data from
   # feature file into Step Definition---------------------------------------------
   #3. Regular Expressions
       # put the data in double quotes [""]
   #4. Scenario Outline
       # Provides you an alternative to Data driven testing
       # Also supports parametrization
  #===================================PARAMETERIZATION================================
  # Executing the same test case with multiple data
  #If you want to use parameterization
  #If you wish to implement data driven testing
  # Scenario Outline is always used along with the keyword 'Examples'
